NA,893786,Dangerous Condition,The tree on the sidewalk directly in front of my house has been leaning more and more in the direction of my house since I took ownership of the home in 2008. The tree is HUGE and my children's bedrooms are located in the front of the house facing the street and tree. In the event that tree comes down it would destroy my home and the thought of potential loss of life is what has prompted me to write this complaint. During storms and or windy days/nights we spend time in the basement where we feel safe. We should not have to feel afraid in our own home. I would love to see the tree taken down and others planted in its place.

NA,410095,Pothole,"There are several ""pedestrian islands"" between Pearl Street and Nassau Street along Frankfort Street in Downtown Manhattan (right next to the Brooklyn Bridge) that have very slanted or broken slopes or potholes nearby between the pedestrian islands and the actual roads. 

These inaccessible ramps make it impossible for wheelchairs or older/disabled people to get on/off the pedestrian islands, forcing wheelchair users and older/disabled people to cross the road or walk on actual traffic lanes along with cars that are speeding/getting off the Brooklyn Bridge and FDR drive. This is very dangerous, especially at night and during bad weather conditions, when cars tend to be driven at high speed. 

My sister is a wheelchair user, and for 3 years, she has had to brave the traffic condition on a daily basis on her way from M15 bus stop on Pearl Street to the Pace University campus, passing by many of these broken ramps on actual roads driven by cars, instead of using these pedestrian islands. 

We have also seen older folks almost get hit by cars in the past while trying to get on the pedestrian islands while cars drive past by at high speeds. This is very dangerous. If the ramps between pedestrian islands and the actual roads could be fixed, or the potholes surrounding these pedestrian islands could be filled and made flat, then wheelchair users and/or older/disabled people can access the ramps and cross the road safely. 

This is a small request for a quick fix that can prevent accidents for pedestrians and disabled people alike.

NA,893786,Dangerous Condition,The tree on the sidewalk directly in front of my house has been leaning more and more in the direction of my house since I took ownership of the home in 2008. The tree is HUGE and my children's bedrooms are located in the front of the house facing the street and tree. In the event that tree comes down it would destroy my home and the thought of potential loss of life is what has prompted me to write this complaint. During storms and or windy days/nights we spend time in the basement where we feel safe. We should not have to feel afraid in our own home. I would love to see the tree taken down and others planted in its place. I love trees and the character they add to the block but feel this tree in particular poses a threat to not only my home but the people living in it.,submitted,3208 163rd St,"New York City, NY",11358,1438799816,0,1,1,40.768974,-73.802116,1,12

NA,410095,Pothole,"There are several ""pedestrian islands"" between Pearl Street and Nassau Street along Frankfort Street in Downtown Manhattan (right next to the Brooklyn Bridge) that have very slanted or broken slopes or potholes nearby between the pedestrian islands and the actual roads. 

These inaccessible ramps make it impossible for wheelchairs or older/disabled people to get on/off the pedestrian islands, forcing wheelchair users and older/disabled people to cross the road or walk on actual traffic lanes along with cars that are speeding/getting off the Brooklyn Bridge and FDR drive. This is very dangerous, especially at night and during bad weather conditions, when cars tend to be driven at high speed. 

My sister is a wheelchair user, and for 3 years, she has had to brave the traffic condition on a daily basis on her way from M15 bus stop on Pearl Street to the Pace University campus, passing by many of these broken ramps on actual roads driven by cars, instead of using these pedestrian islands. 

We have also seen older folks almost get hit by cars in the past while trying to get on the pedestrian islands while cars drive past by at high speeds. This is very dangerous. If the ramps between pedestrian islands and the actual roads could be fixed, or the potholes surrounding these pedestrian islands could be filled and made flat, then wheelchair users and/or older/disabled people can access the ramps and cross the road safely. 

This is a small request for a quick fix that can prevent accidents for pedestrians and disabled people alike.

NA,159758,Stop the dump!,Building the waste transport station in the upper east side is a huge mistake.  You are going to poison the community (especially the kids at asphalt green.)   Building the dump will degrade the area and negatively impact local businesses and pushing out residents.  The area will become a bad neighborhood and such a change will negatively impact the whole of NYC.

NA,157574,Illegal Parking -- *TWO* Vehicles in Fire Hydrant,"Just another night on East 73rd Street at Avenue M!

As always, I have to look outside of my house and worry about the welfare of my family and neighbors. There are TWO cars blocking the fire hydrant. 

One of them (Dark blue VW - Delaware plate # D6397) parks here nightly. Car has over 80 PARKING TICKETS -- unpaid. Who does this woman know that she's avoided a BOOT or tow with $5,000  due in violations? Suspicious, YES.

NYC needs to TOW VIOLATORS ON THE SPOT. These people continue to do what they want. Why must I drive around for 30-40 minutes looking for parking when these guys have a private spot with NO WORRIES about tickets?

All neighbors have complained to 311 and local precinct. They say the cars are gone when they get here, but it's ALWAYS a lie. The cars are STILL HERE when complaint is closed, so no one is even checking.

 This is a waste of time... Our precinct is NO HELP. We have complained religiously for the last YEAR and they never help us. NEVER.",received,1293 E 73rd St,"Brooklyn, NY",11234,1379381122,2,1,1,40.625922,-73.911375,3,Anonymous

-- Over 80 violations in 8-months
-- Outstanding fees total well over $5,000
-- Blocks fire hydrant for DAYS at a time (EVERY DAY!)
... but NYC booted my car over $350 and ticketed us while we sat in hydrant for 2.5-minutes so I could put my wife in the car while in labor a few months ago. Something is wrong with this picture.

Why hasn't this car been booted? It constantly blocks the fire hydrant in front of my home @ East 73rd Street  and Avenue M in Bergen Beach (11234). 

This is a safety issue and this person has NO REGARD for anyone!!! Please forward this message to our local Marshal.

Here we can take care of a dangerous issue that puts residents at risk (God forbid!) AND collect over $5,000 in fines from parking tickets.

WHY is this car still in its owners hands? WHY hasn't the city picked this guys car up, but goes after the petty amounts -- and ignores those with 80  VIOLATIONS IN 8-MONTHS???

Given nyc is both traffic full and resident/ppl full can we simply make honking illegal unless in a life/death situation.  Stressing everyone else or waking ppl up simply to get going a few seconds sooner is selfish and inappropriate. It's imho no longer acceptable in our ""collective first"" generational mindset.  Simply put large signs at all entrance into Manhattan (bridges, tunnels, etc) stating that honking is illegal unless life/death at penalty of 350$ fine should make it happen.

Special driving rules for a very populated or significantly different city is not uncommon.  I'm from Montreal and in all the province we can turn right on red light however it's banned just in Montreal due to level of ppl and tourists and so related risks from confusion etc.
