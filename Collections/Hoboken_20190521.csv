NA,408494,Street Cleaning,"A request to have both Hoboken and Weehawken Dept of Environmental Services to maintain clean roadways over both the Park and Willow Ave bridges in preparation for each weekend through summer and fall now that bicycling season is in full force.   Many of our residents cycle out and back into the City via these two bridges.  The sides of the Park Ave bridge last weekend and today is littered with large stones, appears to be concrete construction debris possibly along with all sorts of other debris that could cause flats and accidents.  Would be simple if a street sweeper could maintain these key roads for our two wheeled residents.

Thank you,

NA,408494,Street Cleaning,"A request to have both Hoboken and Weehawken Dept of Environmental Services to maintain clean roadways over both the Park and Willow Ave bridges in preparation for each weekend through summer and fall now that bicycling season is in full force.   Many of our residents cycle out and back into the City via these two bridges.  The sides of the Park Ave bridge last weekend and today is littered with large stones, appears to be concrete construction debris possibly along with all sorts of other debris that could cause flats and accidents.  Would be simple if a street sweeper could maintain these key roads for our two wheeled residents.

Thank you,
Brian Wagner
